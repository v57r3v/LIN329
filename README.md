Part 1: Distributions (60 marks)Consider   the   following   data   from   Language   P. All   symbols   are   in   IPA transcription   (i.e.   [y]   is   a vowel).pytikabo ‘run’ tekalifyra ‘jump’ ide ‘walk’ 
mygita  ‘swim’ 
ebysilopydi  ‘fly’ 
vyri ‘skip’ 
abogetisapy  ‘float’Q1:   Are   [i] and   [y] in contrastive or complementary distribution in Language P? Provide evidence   for your response. If   the distribution is contrastive, you should provide a minimal or near-minimal   pair, and if   it is complementary, provide a generalization about   the   environments.   (2 points)Q2: Are   [i] and   [e] in contrastive or complementary distribution in Language P? Provide evidence   for your response. If   the distribution is contrastive, you should provide a minimal or near-minimal   pair, and if   it is complementary, provide a generalization about   the   environments.   (2 points)
Q3:   Based   on   the   formulation   given   in   class   for   this   family   of constraints,   define   the   following   constraints (1 point each = 2 points total):
•         Ident-IO[round]
•         Ident-IO[high]Q4:   In   addition   to   the   constraints   from   Q3,   you   will   need   the   following   constraints   for   your   analysis.    For    each    constraint,    state    whether    it    is    a    general    markedness    constraint,    a      special   markedness constraint, or a faithfulness   constraint. Briefly   explain   how   you   know.   (2   points   each   =   8 points total)
•          *LabialUnrounded:   Assign    a    violation    for      every    unrounded    vowel    following    a    labial   consonant in the output.
•          *FrontRounded:   Assign a violation for every front rounded vowel in the   output.
•          *CoronalHigh: Assign   a violation   for   every high vowel   following   a   coronal   consonant   in   the output.
•          *Mid:   Assign a violation for every mid vowel in the   output.Q5: Of   the constraints in Q3 and Q4, three are relevant to the OT analysis of   [i] vs. [y] in Language   P. Which three   constraints   are relevant? For each pair   of   these   three   relevant   constraints,   provide   a   pairwise   comparison   to   illustrate   their   ranking   in   Language   P. You   should   have   three   pairwise   comparisons total. For each pair, you’re expected to:
(1) choose an appropriate   example
(2) choose an appropriate   competing   candidate
(3) fill out the tableaux for the pairwise   comparison   correctly
(4) provide   the   conclusion   about   the   ranking   of   the   constraints (5 points per pair =   15 points total)Q6: Provide two   full tableaux with all   three   constraints   chosen   in   Q5   to   illustrate   the   distribution   of [i] and   [y] in Language P. One tableau should illustrate a form   with   [i]   and   one   should illustrate   a   form. with   [y]. Each tableau   should use three   constraints,   ranked   in   the   appropriate  代 写LIN329: Assignment 1R

(4   points each =   8 points total)Q7: Of   the constraints in Q3 and Q4, three are relevant to the OT analysis of   [i] vs. [e] in Language   P. Which three   constraints   are relevant? For each pair   of   these   three   relevant   constraints,   provide   a   pairwise   comparison   to   illustrate   their   ranking   in   Language   P. You   should   have   three   pairwise   comparisons total. For each pair, you’re expected to:
(1) choose an appropriate   example
(2) choose an appropriate   competing   candidate
(3) fill out the tableaux for the pairwise   comparison   correctly
(4) provide   the   conclusion   about   the   ranking   of   the   constraints (5 points per pair =   15 points total)Q8: Provide two   full tableaux with all   three   constraints   chosen   in   Q7   to   illustrate   the   distribution   of [i] and   [e] in Language P. One tableau should illustrate a   form. with   [i]   and   one   should   illustrate   a   form. with   [e].   Each tableau   should use three   constraints, ranked   in   the   appropriate   order   based on   Q7.   Each   tableau   should   include   the   correct   UR   and   at   least   two   appropriate   candidates.   (4   points each =   8 points total)
Part 2: Stress (40   marks)
Consider the   same   data   from Language P, now with   stress   marked.   Recall   that   all   symbols   are   in   IPA transcription (i.e.   [y] is a vowel).pytíkabò ‘run’ tekalífyrà ‘jump’ idé ‘walk’ 
mygitá  ‘swim’ 
ebýsilòpydì  ‘fly’ 
vyrí ‘skip’ 
abógetìsapỳ  ‘float’
Q1: Re-write the Language P dataset including syllable boundaries and foot boundaries. (7 points)
Q2:   State   the   correct   Language   P parameters   for   each   of the   following   (1   point   each   =   4   points   total):
•         Which   syllable   within   the   foot   receives   greater   stress?
•         Which   edge   of   the   word   is   stressed   determined   from?
•         Must all syllables be contained within   a   foot?
•         Which   stress   is   primary?
Q3: For   each   of   the   following   pairs   of   constraints, provide   a   pairwise   comparison   to   illustrate   the ranking   of   your   constraints. For   each   pair, you’re   expected   to:
(1) choose an appropriate example from the dataset to illustrate these particular constraints 
(2) choose an appropriate   competing   candidate
(3) fill out the tableaux for the pairwise   comparison   correctly
(4) provide   the   conclusion   about   the   ranking   of   the   constraints (5 points per pair = 20 points total)
•         RhTy=T vs. RhTy=I
•         All-Ft-R   vs.   All-Ft-L
•         FtBin   vs. ParseSyll
•         Leftmost   vs. RightmostQ4: Using the eight constraints in Q3, provide a full tableau to illustrate your complete analysis of   the stress system in Language P. You should choose   an   appropriate   example   to   illustrate   all points   of   your   analysis,   and   you   should   have   enough   candidates   to   illustrate   everything   about   your   analysis. Make sure to use dashed vs. solid lines   appropriately   in   your   tableau.   (9 points)
